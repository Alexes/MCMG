Markov Chain Music Generator

This is a program that generates melodies after learning on some music samples.
Resulting is generated in MusicXML format (http://www.musicxml.com/).
Generation algorithm uses two Markov Chains, one for note pitches and another for note durations.


Music in MusicXML format can be played in programs such as MuseScore (http://musescore.org/).
